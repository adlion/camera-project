This project is the interface for spring-camera reository.

It is my first project using Java as backend and Mongo as database

This was developed all (Frontend and Backend in 24 hours) as a challenge from one of my friends.

Feel free to use without any restriction.

Frontend can be found online at: https://adlion.github.io/camera-project/

There is no any content in there due to missing backend.

In order to run please clone the repository and then:

1. `npm install`
2. `ng serve --open`

Please make sure that Mongo and backend is running before running above comands.
